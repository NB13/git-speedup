Speed up git bash on windows
# How to use this
I found the following change on a StackOverflow post that seems to work way faster:

Go to your git install directory (Mine is c:\Program Files (x86)\Git
In the etc folder, open the file 'profile' in a text editor
This file is executed when the bash shell is initialized, you can do a lot of customization in here
Near the bottom, you will find some commands related to setting a variable called PS1 (PS1 = ...)
Either replace it or just append the following lines after it

```bash
fast_git_ps1 ()                                                                              
{                                                                                            
    printf -- "$(git branch 2>/dev/null | grep -e '\* ' | sed 's/^..\(.*\)/ {\1} /')"    
}                                                                                            

PS1='\[\033]0;$MSYSTEM:\w\007                                                                
\033[32m\]\u@\h \[\033[33m\w$(fast_git_ps1)\033[0m\]                                         
$
```
